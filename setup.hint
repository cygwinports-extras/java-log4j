ldesc: "log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to 
a variety of output targets. In case of problems with an application, it 
is helpful to enable logging so that the problem can be located. With 
log4j it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the 
application binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements 
can remain in shipped code without incurring a high performance cost."
